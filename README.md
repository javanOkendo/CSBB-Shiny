# CSBB-Shiny
Computational Suite for Bioinformaticians and Biologists (CSBB), is a RShiny application developed with an intention to empower researchers from wet and dry lab to perform downstream Bioinformatics analysis. CSBB powered by RShiny is packed with 6 modules Visualization, Normalization, Basic Stats, Differential Expression, Correlation Profiles and Function/Pathway Enrichment. These modules are designed in order to help researchers design a hypothesis or answer research questions with little or no expertise in Bioinformatics. CSBB is also available as a command line application and has Next generation sequencing data processing capabilities. New modules and functionalities will be added periodically
